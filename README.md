# Flowty Raffles

This repo contains an implementation of on-chain raffles on the [Flow Blockchain](https://developers.flow.com/). It makes use of 
[on-chain randomness](https://developers.flow.com/build/advanced-concepts/randomness) and an array to select a random item and output it as an
event for everyone to see, making the outcome of a drawing verifiable for anyone to see.
